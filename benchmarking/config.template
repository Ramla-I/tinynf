# Notes:
# If using multiple ports on the same NIC, ensure PCIe bandwidth doesn't become the bottleneck
# PCI addresses must be listed in ascending order so that their order matches in TinyNF and DPDK

# 0-based index of the CPU(s) on which the NF will run
# If you plan on benchmarking with DPDK's testpmd, put at least 2, it'll use one for its main loop
