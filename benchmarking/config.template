# Notes:
# If using multiple ports on the same NIC, ensure PCIe bandwidth doesn't become the bottleneck
# PCI addresses must be listed in ascending order so that their order matches in TinyNF and DPDK

# 0-based index of the CPU on which the NF will run
DUT_CPU=8
# PCI BDF addresses of the DUT's NICs
DUT_DEVS=83:00.0 85:00.0

# Hostname of the tester, such that the DUT can SSH to it
TESTER_HOST=icnalsp3s4
# PCI BDF addresses of the tester's NICs
