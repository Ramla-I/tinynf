things to try out on a blank machine:
- can run basic-tinynf (no baseline, just tinynf.c) without any deps beyond an install.sh script
- can run benchmarks on basic-tinynf, same
- can run benchmarks on baselines-vigor/click (not with dpdk), same
- can run benchmarks on baselines with dpdk, without manually installing it

FIX BUG: max sends treatment is buggy - by default it tries to write to addr 0 (uninitialized) for send tail

compile with musl: REALGCC=gcc-9 TN_CC=musl-gcc TN_CFLAGS='-static -flto -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -Wl,--gc-sections' TN_DEBUG=0 make (this assumes the makefiles puts all cflags as ldflags - not done yet)
