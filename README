things to try out on a blank machine:
- can run basic-tinynf (no baseline, just tinynf.c) without any deps beyond an install.sh script
- can run benchmarks on basic-tinynf, same
- can run benchmarks on baselines-vigor/click (not with dpdk), same
- can run benchmarks on baselines with dpdk, without manually installing it
