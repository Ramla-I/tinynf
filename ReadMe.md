# TinyNF

This repository contains the code associated with the paper ["A Simpler and Faster NIC Driver Model for Network Functions"](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/pirelli) presented at OSDI 2020.
It was awarded the "Artifact Available", "Artifact Functional", and "Results Reproduced" badges after artifact evaluation.

The code of the "TinyNF" driver is in `code/`.

The benchmarking scripts for NFs, which are independent of TinyNF, are in `benchmarking/`.

The experiments presented in the paper, including replication instructions, are in `experiments/`.
